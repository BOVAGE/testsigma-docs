![Test Plan Overview](https://docs.testsigma.com/images/test-plan-executions/test-plan-overview.jpeg)

A Test Plan is a set of Test Suites. When a test plan is executed, the test suites and their corresponding test cases are executed, either serially or parallelly, as configured.

In this document, we will discuss the execution of a test plan that has one test suite and the test suite that has one test case.
