When creating test steps using the Test Recorder in Testsigma, there are various types of test data that you can use. In this document, we will discuss how to add that test data while you are recording test steps for an iOS project in Testsigma. Refer to [supported test data types in Testsigma](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-data/types/overview/).

##**Pre-requisites:**
You should already know how to:

1. [create an iOS project](https://testsigma.com/docs/projects/overview/).

2. [use Test Recorder to create test steps](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/create-steps-recorder/ios-apps/overview/).

3. [create a test case](https://testsigma.com/docs/test-cases/manage/add-edit-delete/).
